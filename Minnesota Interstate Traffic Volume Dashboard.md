## 🎯 Business Problem

The Minnesota Department of Transportation needed a data-driven solution to better understand:

- Traffic volumes by time – including year, month, week, day, and hour
- Traffic patterns during different weather conditions
- Holiday-related traffic spikes

Understanding these patterns allows MnDOT to reduce disruptions during road work, optimize traffic flow, and improve public safety.
